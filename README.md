# crypto-key-derivation
Document all the mess around bip32+bip39+bip44 and similar key generation schemes

# Overview
Our overall goal is to generate bitcoin/litecoin/ethereum/etc
private+public keys from a list of english words.  We also want to
keep compatibility with hardware wallets (Trezor One and Ledger Nano
S), so we can use this tool in an emergency when a hardware wallet is
not available.  If you want other hardware wallets to be tested too,
feel free to donate.

BIP39: Given a list of words, generate a seed (512 bit),
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki

BIP32: Given a seed (any 128-512 bit will do), generate a master key
which can be used to generate further subkeys.

BIP44: Just a bunch of recommendations on how to use BIP39+BIP32
together.  This is followed by some wallets (e.g. Trezor), while not
followed by others (e.g. Electrum).

# Setup

    sudo apt install libsecp256k1-dev
    ./init-venv.sh

# BIP39
Online tool: https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/#english

The standard BIP39 seed derivation can be used like this:

```
$ ./bip39.py <<EOF
> scissors invite lock maple supreme raw rapid void congress muscle digital elegant little brisk hair mango congress clump
> TREZOR
> EOF
7b4a10be9d98e6cba265566db7f136718e1398c71cb581e1b2f464cac1ceedf4f3e274dc270003c670ad8d02c4558b2f8e39edea2775c9e232c7cb798b069e88
```

The string "TREZOR" here is the so called passphrase, which in BIP39
makes it possible for the user to add an additional phrase not in an
english dictionary.  You do not have to use it if you don't want to:

```
$ ./bip39.py <<EOF
> scissors invite lock maple supreme raw rapid void congress muscle digital elegant little brisk hair mango congress clump
> EOF
a555426999448df9022c3afc2ed0e4aebff3a0ac37d8a395f81412e14994efc960ed168d39a80478e0467a3d5cfc134fef2767c1d3a27f18e3afeb11bfc8e6ad
```

# BIP39, Electrum variant
If you create a new wallet with Electrum, they use a modified version
of BIP39, because they have some reasons how theirs is better...

```
$ ./electrum_mnemonic.py <<EOF
> scissors invite lock maple supreme raw rapid void congress muscle digital elegant little brisk hair mango congress clump

# BIP32
Once we have a seed, we can use BIP32 for the derivation of a
hierarchy of keys.

The tree starts with one root, and every node in the tree can have
2^31 non-hardened and 2^31 hardened child.

The generation unfortunately generates invalid children with
probability less than 1/2^127.  We haven't made any effort in this
toolchain to handle or detect these issues...

Every level (including the root and the leafs) of the hierarchy has a
so called extended private key, from which everything below the tree
can be generated.  This is a string starting with "xprv".  From this
we can generate an extended public key (starting with "xpub"), which
can be used to generate the 2^31 non-hardened sub extended public
keys.  Subnodes are indexed from 0 to 2^31-1.

This means that as far as you are using non-hardened derivation paths,
you can generate all the valid public keys from the root without
knowing any of the secrets.  This can be used to gather balances
without having the ability to spend them (e.g. webshop).

Math warning: anyone who has the extended public key, and just ONE
(non-extended, normal) secret key, can calculate all the secret keys
in the whole hierarcy (up and down and sideways), until a hardening
boundary is met.

The standard notation of a path in the tree is like this:
"m/44'/0'/0'/1/3".  Here we generating the root from a seed and then
taking the path of: harden 44 -> harden 0 -> harden 0 -> non-harden 1
-> non-harden 3.  Note the apostrophes, when they are present, that's
a hardened derivation in the path.  According to BIP44, this is the
4th change address of the first account in a wallet.

We provide the following utilities to walk the tree:

`seed2xprv.py`: stdin is a hex encoded seed from the BIP39 chapter,
stdout is an xprv, containing the root of the tree.  This path is
usually called "m" or "m/".

`seed2xprv-ed25519.py`: same as `seed2xprv.py`, but have to use this
one if you are generating XLM or XTZ addresses.

`xderive.py 10`: stdin is an xprv/xpub, output is the xprv/xpub of
10th child on the next level.

`xderive.py 10h`: stdin is an xprv/xpub, output is the xprv/xpub of
10th hardened child on the next level.

`xderive.py n`: stdin is an xprv, output is the xpub (that doesn't
have the secret anymore, `n` stands for neutered).

`x2btc.py`: stdin is an xprv/xpub, output is a BTC secret key or
address.  You can use https://www.bitaddress.org/ to check the keypair.

`x2eth.py`: stdin is an xprv/xpub, output is an ETH secret key or
address.  You can use https://www.myetherwallet.com/, to check the keypair.

`x2xrp.py`: stdin is an xprv/xpub, output is an XRP secret key (usable
with http://ripplerm.github.io/ripple-wallet/) or an XRP address.

`x2xlm.py`: stdin is an xprv or an xpub, output is an XLM private key or address.

`x2xtz.py`: stdin is an xprv or an xpub, output is an XTZ private key or address.

`tools/xkeydump.py`: stdin is an xprv or an xpub, stdout is human readable dump.

Note, that for P2SH and legacy the casing of the address is important,
for the new segwit address type everything is lowercase.

# A full example for BTC+Electrum

Given the initial seed of "aerobic melody aerobic join crunch quiz
ring icon brisk speak someone marine", we generate the electrum
specific binary seed, from which we get an xprv and convert it to
xpub.  Once we have the xpub, the only thing we need to know is that
Electrum stores public addresses at "m/0/i" and change addresses at
"m/1/i".

Therefore:

```
$ ./electrum_mnemonic.py <<< "aerobic melody aerobic join crunch quiz ring icon brisk speak someone marine" | ./seed2xprv.py | ./xderive.py 0 n | { read xpub ; for i in `seq 0 4` ; do echo $xpub | ./xderive.py $i | ./x2btc.py ; done ; }

# XLM (Stellar) + Trezor/LedgerNanoS

Unfortunately XLM (Stellar) uses the BIP32 derivation a bit
differently (because it uses the curve ed25519 instead of secp256k1).

The ED25519 curve doesn't support the same trick regarding
public-private derivations as Secp256k1.  (Although Cardano has an
extension to make it happen, but that extension is not used by
Stellar.)

This means that with XLM, you will always have to use private hardened
derivations and then only in the last step (before printing the
address) can you go to xpub with `xderive.py n`.

Also note, that we had to extend the xpub/xprv format a bit, to
represent the fact that the key is an ed25519 key, not a secp256k1, so
the intermediate xprv/xpub strings might not be compatible with any
other tool when using XLM.  If you find any RFC/SLIP/BIP that
documents how to properly encode xprv/xpub for XLM, please contact us
via Github.

# XRP (Ripple)

Info about XRP key generation in the original XRP wallet: https://xrpl.org/cryptographic-keys.html

Info about address encoding: https://xrpl.org/accounts.html#address-encoding

Trezor One doesn't support XRP.  The Ledger Nano S wallet supports XRP
with derivation path of m/44'/144'/0'/0/0.  But the resulting keypair
at this derivation path is used DIRECTLY, and the picture described in
the XRP documentation
(https://xrpl.org/cryptographic-keys.html#secp256k1-key-derivation) is
not used at all.

This means that XRP is a very weird crypto regarding BIP32: I can
generate you the public key that will be the same as Ledger Nano's
key, but I can't give you a private seed that XRP wallets will accept,
because the XRP wallets want to have a seed and then run the algorithm
in the above picture on the seed to get the private key.  But we don't
have a seed, we have the private key itself.  So because of this, the
`x2xrp.py` tool will never be able to give you a secret seed usable with
native XRP tools.

To interact with the XRP chain without a hardware wallet, somebody
would have to implement a desktop/javascript client that accepts a
private key (in some encoding, e.g. hex), instead of a seed.  And
there is an implementation like that, here:
http://ripplerm.github.io/ripple-wallet/

So in an emergency, when you don't have a hardware wallet, and still
want to do XRP transactions with your private key, you have to use
this web tool, since it's compatible with our `x2xrp.py` hex output.

# XTZ (Tezos)

XTZ is using three different curves: ED25519 for tz1 addresses,
Secp256k1 for tz2 addresses and Secp256r1 for tz3 addresses.  This
tool currently supports two of the curves, ED25519/tz1 and
Secp256k1/tz2.  Please see the caveats concerning ED25519/tz1
mentioned in the section on XLM.

# Generating the last word in the passphrase.

In bip39 the passphrase checksum should be valid. After choosing the first n-1
words randomly the last can be chosen only from a subset of words. Generate
the list like this:

    $ ./bip39-last-word/last_word.py <<< "scissors invite lock maple supreme raw rapid void congress muscle digital elegant little brisk hair mango congress"
    Good last words:
    alcohol
    another
    ball
    brother
    cherry
    clump
    ...
    A random choice would be:
    photo

For reading words interactively in shuffled order (against keylogger):

    $ ./bip39-last-word/interactive_input.py 23 | ./bip39-last-word/last_word.py
